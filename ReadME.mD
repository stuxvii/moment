# ACID'S CLIPPING KIT
FOR THIS TO WORK YOU MUST DROP A BINARY CALLED ffmpeg.exe THAT CORRESPONDS TO AN FFMPEG BUILD
<br>
<br>GET ONE FROM HERE
<br>https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.7z
<br>
<br>THE FOLDER OF THE PROGRAM MUST CONTAIN THESE FILES:
<br>
<br>ffmpeg.exe <-- NEW FILE DROPPED BY YOU
<br>moment.exe
<br>
## PROGRAM OPERATION:
<br>AT STARTUP THE PROGRAM WILL CLEANUP THE PREVIOUS SESSION AND SEARCH FOR A CONFIGURATION FILE NAMED ack.cfg
<br>IF THIS FILE ISNT READABLE IT WILL GENERATE A NEW ONE
<br>THE PROGRAM WILL CONSTANTLY MANTAIN AND WRITE TO TWO VIDEO BUFFERS, AND SWITCH BETWEEN THEM WHENEVER THE CURRENTLY USED BUFFER HAS REACHED THE MAX SPECIFIED LIMIT.
<br>
<br>WHEN PRESSING THE CLIP SAVING BUTTON THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE WILL BEGIN, AND 3 BEEPS SHOULD PLAY IN SEQUENCE

## BEEP MEANING:
1. BEGAN
2. MERGED TWO BUFFERS IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER
3. FINISHED OUTPUTTING CLIP

## CONFIGURATION:
<br>ack.cfg CONTAINS 4 KEYS
- time: recording limit
- fps: frames per second of the recording
- kbps: bitrate of recording
- key: the key that will trigger a clip (YOU MAY FIND A LIST AT https://docs.rs/device_query/latest/device_query/keymap/enum.Keycode.html UNDER "Variants")
- encoder: this will set the encoding method used for encoding the video (get it? ok? ok.)

encoding modes:

0. software
1. amd
1. nvidia
1. intel

## HOW TO USE
<br>PRESS THE KEY TO SAVE A CLIP CONTAINING AT MOST THE LAST PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF SECONDS OF SCREEN DATA TO THE DIRECTORY THAT moment.exe IS RAN FROM.
<br>AFTER PRESSING THE KEY BOTH TEMP VIDEO BUFFERS WILL BE RESET
<br>YOU CAN RIGHT CLICK THE TRAY ICON AND SELECT QUIT OR PRESS LEFTCTRL+F1 TO EXIT THE PROGRAM CLEANLY
<br>
## KNOWN ISSUES:
1.
- ISSUE: TRAYICONS PERSIST AFTER PROGRAM EXIT
- TEMPORARY SOLUTION: HOVER OVER ICON TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR
2.
- ISSUE: HIGH GPU USAGE
- EXPLANATION: THIS IS DUE TO HOW FRAMES ARE ENCODED AND TRASMITTED. EVERYTHING IS SENT IN *RAW*, FOR A 1080P VIDEO EACH FRAME CONTAINS 8 ENTIRE MEGABYTES OF DATA, 8 * 30 = 240MB/S A SECOND. ***A SECOND.*** MULTIPLY THAT BY 15 SECONDS. YEAH. I AM CURRENTLY RESEARCHING METHODS TO EITHER REDUCE THIS OR BALANCE THIS. CURRENT WORKAROUND IS REDUCING THE FRAME RATE AND BITRATE.
<br>
<br>YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS WORKING WHEN YOU SEE A TRAY ICON.
